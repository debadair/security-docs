== Histograms

Time-based histograms show you the number of detections, alerts, and events that have occurred within the selected time range. To focus on areas of interest in time-based histograms, select a region to reflect a date range, or select a preset value in the timepicker. In the *Stack by* dropdown, you can select specific parameters to visualize individual counts. For example, in the Detection alert trend histogram, stack by `kibana.alert.rule.name` to display the total counts by alert name within the specified time frame.

TIP: Many {elastic-sec} histograms, graphs, and tables contain an *Inspect* button so you can examine the {es} queries used to retrieve data throughout the app.

== Host and network events

View event and host counts specific to Elastic data shippers and apps, such as *Auditbeats* or *{endpoint-cloud-sec}*. Expand each category to view specific counts of hosts or network events related to the selected category.
